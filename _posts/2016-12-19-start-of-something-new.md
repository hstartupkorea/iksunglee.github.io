Started with the study plan from <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university#did-i-get-the-job"> jwasham </a> on my journey to a decent programmer.
A lot of things happend for the past new days. 
It's better I lay it out for you in array format:

[0] Managed to start watch videos about arrays </br>
[1] Found out that there is an separate language for blogging (markdown language)</br>
    I will learn this if I have the time. </br>
[2] Organization of information is everything. I started reorganizing my notes in a binder (finally) </br>
[3] Will be coding at least 30 min. a day to start a habit of coding.</br>
    *websites (weekend, occational fridays) </br>
    *data structures (weekdays) </br>
[4] Started using <a href="http://ankisrs.net/"> anki </a>, a new type of flash card program (open-source). </br>
[5] I realized that jagged arrays exists. (Yes, I am ashamed of this) </br>
[6] started to love web-based commits through github. (I will one day use terminal commands to do this, hopefully) </br>
[7] started reading the korean version of programming interview exposed secretes to landing your next job 3rd ed. </br>
     *can't display in Korean -- must look into this bug. </br>

Stuff that I need build on: </br>
[0] actual coding: I've been losing my sense of coding arrays and lists. </br>
[1] websites: need to make something solely based on css. on (codepen) </br>
[2] start brushing up on assembly language for next semester. </br>

thanks about it. more to come in the future. </br>

Future Googler.
