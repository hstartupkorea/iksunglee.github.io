Started with the study plan from <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university#did-i-get-the-job"> jwasham </a> on my journey to a decent programmer.
A lot of things happend for the past new days. 
It's better I lay it out for you in array format:

[0] Managed to start watch videos about arrays
[1] Found out that there is an separate language for blogging (markdown language)
    I will learn this if I have the time.
[2] Organization of information is everything. I started reorganizing my notes in a binder (finally)
[3] Will be coding at least 30 min. a day to start a habit of coding.
    *websites (weekend, occational fridays)
    *data structures (weekdays)
[4] Started using <a href="http://ankisrs.net/"> anki </a>, a new type of flash card program (open-source).
[5] I realized that jagged arrays exists. (Yes, I am ashamed of this)
[6] started to love web-based commits through github. (I will one day use terminal commands to do this, hopefully)
[7] started reading the korean version of programming interview exposed secretes to landing your next job 3rd ed.
     *can't display in Korean -- must look into this bug.

Stuff that I need build on:
[0] actual coding: I've been losing my sense of coding arrays and lists.
[1] websites: need to make something solely based on css. on (codepen)
[2] start brushing up on assembly language for next semester.

thanks about it. more to come in the future.

Future Googler.
