Still getting used to markdown language. <br>
A lot of things have been done. Finally I have finished implementing my personal brand logo.<br>
There are a lot of things I don't know yet about jekyll framework but will soon understand it soon. (hopefully)<br>
<br>
Found the solutions to the problem in freecodecamp but understood only 80 percent of the code. <br>
Further investigate the idea of arguements in javascript. Still getting confused on the topic.<br>
<br>
More lectures on the Asymptotic Notations day after tomorrow due to family-related issues.<br>
<br>
Idea: Write difficult concepts and explain it through "special edition blogs" teaching the audience how to look at such concepts.
<br>* must look into this idea.<br>
