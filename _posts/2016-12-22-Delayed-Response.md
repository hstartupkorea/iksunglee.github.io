Today I missed one day of coding because I had to help my sister with her stuff coming back to the house after a semester of college.
It was okay but the travel was total of 5 hrs away back and forth. I know for some of you guys it's a bit of an over statement but in our Korean Standards it's pretty far.
<br>
Anyway back to the main topic,
Delayed Response. Emails are awesome but when it gets into your daily routine you tend to push it back. <br>
and I tend to do something about it.

Game plan, Create a time slot or a pre-arranged reply that can be turned on and off so that I could use it for non-interrupted schedule. <br>
Will write about this tomorrow. <br>

As for my coding load. I haven't solved a coding challenge yet. <br>
I should alot 2 pomodoro sessions to this activity. <br>

-- End of File -- <br>
ps. this alots of 21 and 22.
